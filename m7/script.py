"""
Here's an example of a skeleton you might have for Monday.  Note that your
code does NOT have to be fully-formed at this point or follow good programming
style.  This is just a quick outline of your overall plan with code.  (I made
this in about 10 minutes on the way to my ad hoc meeting today.)

Feel free to include #TODO comments as part of your outline that indicate
where you will expand (see examples below).

Again - the point of this assignment is NOT to have your computer develop an
entire script on the level of a human writer (unless you would like it to be!).
The main idea is to use play/film/TV scripts as a domain to demonstrate your
understanding of ideas in CC and explore a small, focused topic relating to this
domain (such as "agent personality modeling" or "joke generation").

I will not expect your script to be sophisticated in all degrees and dimensions
of CC. Instead, I'm just looking for you to show that you did some research in a
CC area, you have some interesting results due to that exploration, and you are
able to present and write comfortably about your work.
